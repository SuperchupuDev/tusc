# tusc
The ultimate social content video downloader
Mostly used as a personal utility, using yt-dlp is annoying sometimes

Unstable, **can** break, as this is just a personal project not meant for public use

## Installation
```sh-session
npm i -g @superchupu/tusc
```

## Usage
```bash
tusc <url> [options]
```
The current only option is `-e` to make explorer not run on finish

## Requirements
`yt-dlp` is **required** for it to work, as this is mostly a wrapper around it.
